===============================

The game has no depencies and runs on its own.

Use arrow keys to move.

Notes:

The logs drift apart over time because of the way they are constructed from single blocks and loop over time according to delta ticks.

The sound cannot be turned off.

There is no reset button - you must refresh the page.
