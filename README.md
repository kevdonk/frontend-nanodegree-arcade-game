The hero of the game is 'donk' the little monkey I drew in paint for the first portfolio project because I needed an image.
I used him again in the interactive resume ( http://kevdonk.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-resume/ ) and converted him to a .png with transparent background for use in this game.

The logs are of equally terrible quality, drawn over top of the supplied water-block.png.

Notes:

The logs drift apart over time because of the way they are constructed from single blocks and loop over time according to delta ticks.

The sound cannot be turned off.

There is no reset button - you must refresh the page.
